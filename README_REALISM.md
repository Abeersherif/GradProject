# 🏥 How to Get Photorealistic Organs (Option A - Fixed)

**Update:** Specific links were broken, so we now direct you to the **Search Results** where you can choose any free model you like.

## 🚀 The Fastest Way

1. Run the **updated** helper script:
   ```bash
   python get_realistic_organs.py
   ```
   This will open 4 tabs with **pre-filtered search results** for valid models.

2. **Pick a Model**: Click on any model that looks good (and is free).

3. **Download**:
   - Look for the **Download** button.
   - Choose **GLB** format (preferred) or GLTF.
   - *Note: You may need a free Sketchfab account to download.*

4. **Rename & Move** to `assets/`:
   - `heart.glb`
   - `kidneys.glb`
   - `pancreas.glb`
   - `eyes.glb`

5. **Refresh** `index.html`.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting
- **"File not found"**: Make sure the name is exactly `heart.glb` (lowercase).
- **"Model is white/grey"**: My engine will automatically color it red/pink/etc, don't worry about the model's original color.
