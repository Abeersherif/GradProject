Subject: Academic Developer API Access Request - Graduation Project (MedTwin Digital Twin)

Dear BioDigital Team,

I am a university student working on my graduation project called **MedTwin** - a Digital Twin platform for chronic disease management focusing on Type 2 Diabetes.

**Project Overview:**
MedTwin creates personalized digital representations of patients to visualize organ health and predict disease progression over time. We use AI-driven analysis to help patients and healthcare providers understand diabetes complications affecting organs like the heart, kidneys, pancreas, and eyes.

**Why BioDigital:**
Your "Systemic Insulin and Glucose in Type 2 Diabetes" model is exactly what we need to provide professional, medically-accurate 3D visualization. We would like to integrate the BioDigital Human API to:
- Display organ health status with color-coded risk indicators
- Allow users to interact with specific organs (heart, pancreas, kidneys, eyes)
- Connect the visualization to our backend digital twin data

**Request:**
We are requesting academic/educational access to the BioDigital Developer API for our graduation project. This is a non-commercial, educational project that will be demonstrated to our university examination committee.

**Project Details:**
- University: [YOUR UNIVERSITY NAME]
- Project: MedTwin - Chronic Disease Digital Twin
- Duration: [PROJECT DURATION]
- Purpose: Academic/Educational (Graduation Project)
- Team Size: [NUMBER OF TEAM MEMBERS]

We would greatly appreciate any academic licensing, trial access, or educational partnership opportunity that would allow us to use the Developer API.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
